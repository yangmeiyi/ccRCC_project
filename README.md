## Introduction
In this repository we release models from the paper "CT-based Transformer model for non-invasively predicting the Fuhrman nuclear grade of clear cell renal cell carcinoma".

TransResNet was proposed to predict the low and high nuclear grade ccRCC, which combines the advantages of Transformer and ResNet.
