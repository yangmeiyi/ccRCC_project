## Introduction
In this repository we release models from the paper "CT-based Transformer model for non-invasively predicting the Fuhrman nuclear grade of clear cell renal cell carcinoma".

TransResNet was proposed to predict the low and high nuclear grade ccRCC, which combines the advantages of Transformer and ResNet. The proposed TransResNet model obtained an average accuracy of 87.1%, a sensitivity of 91.3%, a specificity of 85.3%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 90.3% on the collected ccRCC data set containing 759 patients.
